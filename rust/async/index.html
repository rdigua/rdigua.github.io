<p>Mar 1, 2019</p>

<p>I wanted to post a quick update on the status of the async-await effort. The short version is that we’re in the  <strong>home stretch</strong>  for some kind of stabilization, but there remain some significant questions to overcome.</p>

<h2 id="announcing-the-implementation-working-group-http-smallcultfollowing-com-babysteps-blog-2019-03-01-async-await-status-report-announcing-the-implementation-working-group">Announcing the implementation working group[](<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/03/01/async-await-status-report/#announcing-the-implementation-working-group">http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/03/01/async-await-status-report/#announcing-the-implementation-working-group</a>)</h2>

<p>As part of this push, I’m happy to announce we’ve formed a  <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/README.md"><strong>async-await implementation working group</strong></a>. This working group is part of the whole async-await effort, but focused on the implementation, and is part of the compiler team. If you’d like to help get async-await over the finish line, we’ve got a list of issues where we’d definitely like help (read on).</p>

<p><strong>If you are interested in taking part, we have an “office hours” scheduled for Tuesday (see the  <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team#meeting-calendar[">compiler team calendar</a>)</strong>  – if you can show up then on  <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/about/chat-platform.md">Zulip</a>, it’d be ideal! (But if not, just pop in any time.)</p>

<h2 id="who-are-we-stabilizing-for-http-smallcultfollowing-com-babysteps-blog-2019-03-01-async-await-status-report-who-are-we-stabilizing-for">Who are we stabilizing for?[](<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/03/01/async-await-status-report/#who-are-we-stabilizing-for">http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/03/01/async-await-status-report/#who-are-we-stabilizing-for</a>)</h2>

<p>I mentioned that there remain significant questions to overcome before stabilization. I think the most root question of all is this one:  <strong>Who is the audience for this stabilization?</strong></p>

<p>The reason that question is so important is because it determines how to weigh some of the issues that currently exist. If the point of the stabilization is to start promoting async-await as something for<strong>widespread use</strong>, then there are  <strong>issues that we probably ought to resolve first</strong>  – most notably, the  <code>await</code>  syntax, but also other things.</p>

<p>If, however, the point of stabilization is to let  <strong>‘early adopters’</strong>  start playing with it more, then  <strong>we might be more tolerant of problems</strong>, so long as there are no backwards compatibility concerns.</p>

<p>My take is that either of these is a perfectly fine answer. But  <strong>if the answer is that we are trying to unblock early adopters, then we want to be clear in our messaging</strong>, so that people don’t get turned off when they encounter some of the bugs below.</p>

<p>OK, with that in place, let’s look in a bit more detail.</p>

<h2 id="implementation-issues-http-smallcultfollowing-com-babysteps-blog-2019-03-01-async-await-status-report-implementation-issues">Implementation issues[](<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/03/01/async-await-status-report/#implementation-issues">http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/03/01/async-await-status-report/#implementation-issues</a>)</h2>

<p>One of the first things that we did in setting up the implementation working group is to do a  <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Async-Await-Triage-2019.02.20--AYdZ6puVcqdJ0Jnu37FRiisiAg-ZyzRUbTENfdgFjCRja2vm">complete triage of all existing async-await issues</a>. From this, we found that there was one very firm blocker,  <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54716">#54716</a>. This issue has to do the timing of drops in an async fn, specifically the drop order for parameters that are not used in the fn body. We want to be sure this behaves analogously with regular functions. This is a blocker to stabilization because it would change the semantics of stable code for us to fix it later.</p>

<p>We also uncovered a number of  <strong>major ergonomic problems</strong>. In a follow-up meeting (<a href="https://youtu.be/xe2_whJWBC0">available on YouTube</a>), cramertj and I also drew up plans for  <strong>fixing these bugs</strong>, though these plans have not yet been writting into mentoring instructions. These issues include all focus around async fns that take borrowed references as arguments – for example, the  <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/56238">async fn syntax today doesn’t support more than one lifetime in the arguments</a>, so something like  <code>async fn foo(x: &amp;u32, y: &amp;u32)</code>  doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Whether these ergonomic problems are  <strong>blockers</strong>, however, depends a bit on your perspective: as @cramertj says, a number of folks at Google are using async-await today productively despite these limitations, but you must know the appropriate workarounds and so forth.  <strong>This is where the question of our audience comes into play.</strong>  My take is that these issues are blockers for “async fn” being ready for “general use”, but probably not for “early adopters”.</p>

<p>Another big concern for me personally is the  <strong>maintenance story</strong>. Thanks to the hard work of Zoxc and cramertj, we’ve been able to standup a functional async-await implementation very fast, which is awesome. But we don’t really have a large pool of active contributors working on the async-await implementation who can help to fix issues as we find them, and this seems bad.</p>

<h2 id="the-syntax-question-http-smallcultfollowing-com-babysteps-blog-2019-03-01-async-await-status-report-the-syntax-question">The syntax question[](<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/03/01/async-await-status-report/#the-syntax-question">http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/03/01/async-await-status-report/#the-syntax-question</a>)</h2>

<p>Finally, we come to the question of the  <code>await</code>  syntax. At the All Hands, we had a number of conversations on this topic, and it became clear that  <strong>we do not presently have consensus for any one syntax</strong>. We did a  <strong>lot</strong>  of exploration here, however, and enumerated a number of subtle arguments in favor of each option. At this moment, @withoutboats is busily trying to write-up that exploration into a document.</p>

<p>Before saying anything else, it’s worth pointing out that we don’t actually  <strong>have</strong>  to resolve the  <code>await</code>syntax in order to stabilize async-await. We could stabilize the  <code>await!(...)</code>  macro syntax for the time being, and return to the issue later. This would unblock “early adopters”, but doesn’t seem like a satisfying answer if our target is the “general public”. If we were to do this, we’d be drawing on the precedent of  <code>try!</code>, where we first adopted a macro and later moved that support to native syntax.</p>

<p>That said, we do  <strong>eventually</strong>  want to pick another syntax, so it’s worth thinking about how we are going to do that. As I wrote, the first step is to complete an overall summary that tries to describe the options on the table and some of the criteria that we can use to choose between them. Once that is available, we will need to settle on next steps.</p>

<h2 id="resolving-hard-questions-http-smallcultfollowing-com-babysteps-blog-2019-03-01-async-await-status-report-resolving-hard-questions">Resolving hard questions[](<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/03/01/async-await-status-report/#resolving-hard-questions">http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/03/01/async-await-status-report/#resolving-hard-questions</a>)</h2>

<p>I am looking at the syntax question as a kind of opportunity – one of the things that we as a community frequently have to do is to find a way to  <strong>resolve really hard questions without a clear answer</strong>. The tools that we have for doing this at the moment are really fairly crude: we use discussion threads and manual summary comments. Sometimes, this works well. Sometimes, amazingly well. But other times, it can be a real drain.</p>

<p>I would like to see us trying to resolve this sort of issue in other ways. I’ll be honest and say that I don’t entirely know what those are,  <strong>but I know they are not open discussion threads</strong>. For example, I’ve found that the #rust2019 blog posts have been an incredibly effective way to have an open conversation about priorities without the usual ranchor and back-and-forth. I’ve been very inspired by systems like  <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611816/the-simple-but-ingenious-system-taiwan-uses-to-crowdsource-its-laws/">vTaiwan</a>, which enable a lot of public input, but in a structured and collaborative form, rather than an “antagonistic” one. Similarly, I would like to see us perhaps consider running more  <em>experiments</em>  to test hypotheses about learnability or other factors (but this is something I would approach with great caution, as I think designing good experiments is very hard).</p>

<p>Anyway, this is really a topic for a post of its own. In this particular case, I hope that we find that enumerating in detail the arguments for each side leads us to a clear conclusion, perhaps some kind of “third way” that we haven’t seen yet. But, thinking ahead, it’d be nice to find ways to have these conversations that take us to that “third way” faster.</p>

<p>As someone who has not been closely following async-await thus far, I’m super excited by all I see. The feature has come a ridiculously long way, and the remaining blockers all seem like things we can overcome. async await is coming: I can’t wait to see what people build with it.</p>

<p>Jul 8, 2019</p>

<p>I wanted to give an update on the status of the “async-await foundations” working group. This post aims to cover three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the “async await MVP” that we are currently targeting;</li>
<li>how that fits into the bigger picture;</li>
<li>and how you can help, if you’re so inclined;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="current-target-async-await-mvp-http-smallcultfollowing-com-babysteps-blog-2019-07-08-async-await-status-report-2-current-target-async-await-mvp">Current target: async-await MVP[](<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/07/08/async-await-status-report-2/#current-target-async-await-mvp">http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/07/08/async-await-status-report-2/#current-target-async-await-mvp</a>)</h2>

<p>We are currently working on stabilizing what we call the  <strong>async-await MVP</strong>  – as in, “minimal viable product”. As the name suggests, the work we’re doing now is basically the minimum that is needed to “unlock” async-await. After this work is done, it will be easier to build async I/O based applications in Rust, though a number of rough edges remain.</p>

<p>The MVP consists of the following pieces:</p>

<ul>
<li>the  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html"><code>Future</code></a>  trait, which defines the core future protocol (stabilized in  <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/07/04/Rust-1.36.0.html">1.36.0</a>!);</li>
<li>basic async-await syntax;</li>
<li>a “first edition” of  <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/index.html">the “async Rust” book</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-future-trait-http-smallcultfollowing-com-babysteps-blog-2019-07-08-async-await-status-report-2-the-future-trait">The future trait[](<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/07/08/async-await-status-report-2/#the-future-trait">http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/07/08/async-await-status-report-2/#the-future-trait</a>)</h3>

<p>The first of these bullets, the future trait, was stabilized in the  <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/07/04/Rust-1.36.0.html">1.36.0</a>  release. This is important because the  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html"><code>Future</code></a>  trait is the core building block for the whole Async I/O ecosystem. Having a stable future trait means that we can begin the process of consolidating the ecosystem around it.</p>

<h3 id="basic-async-await-syntax-http-smallcultfollowing-com-babysteps-blog-2019-07-08-async-await-status-report-2-basic-async-await-syntax">Basic async-await syntax[](<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/07/08/async-await-status-report-2/#basic-async-await-syntax">http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/07/08/async-await-status-report-2/#basic-async-await-syntax</a>)</h3>

<p>Now that the future trait is stable, the next step is to stabilize the basic “async-await” syntax. We are presently shooting to stabilize this in 1.38. We’ve finished the largest work items, but there are still a number of things left to get done before that date – if you’re interested in helping out, see the “how you can help” section at the end of this post!</p>

<p>The current support we are aiming to stabilize permits  <code>async fn</code>, but only outside of traits and trait implementations. This means that you can write free functions like this one:<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/07/08/async-await-status-report-2/#fn:highlight">1</a></p>

<pre><code>// When invoked, returns a future that (once awaited) will yield back a result:
async fn process(data: TcpStream) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; {
    let mut buf = vec![0u8; 1024];
    
    // Await data from the stream:
    let len = reader.read(&amp;mut buf).await?;
    ...
}

</code></pre>

<p>or inherent methods:</p>

<pre><code>impl MyType {
    // Same as above, but defined as a method on `MyType`:
    async fn process(data: TcpStream) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; { .. }
}

</code></pre>

<p>You can also write async blocks, which generate a future “in place” without defining a separate function. These are particularly useful to pass as arguments to helpers like  <a href="https://docs.rs/runtime/0.3.0-alpha.5/runtime/fn.spawn.html"><code>runtime::spawn</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>let data: TcpStream;
runtime::spawn(async move {
    let mut buf = vec![0u8; 1024];
    let len = reader.read(&amp;mut buf).await?;
    ...
})

</code></pre>

<p>Eventually, we plan to permit  <code>async fn</code>  in other places, but there are some complications to be resolved first, as will be discussed shortly.</p>

<h3 id="the-async-book-http-smallcultfollowing-com-babysteps-blog-2019-07-08-async-await-status-report-2-the-async-book">The async book[](<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/07/08/async-await-status-report-2/#the-async-book">http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/07/08/async-await-status-report-2/#the-async-book</a>)</h3>

<p>One of the goals of this stabilization is that, once async-await syntax becomes available, there should be  <strong>really strong documentation to help people get started</strong>. To that end, we’re rejuvenating  <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/index.html">the “async Rust” book</a>. This book covers the nuts and bolts of Async I/O in Rust, ranging from simple examples with<code>async fn</code>  all the way down to the details of how the future trait works, writing your own executors, and so forth. Take a look!</p>

<p>(Eventually, I expect some of this material may make its way into more standard books like  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Programming Language</a>, but in the meantime we’re evolving it separately.)</p>

<h2 id="future-work-the-bigger-picture-http-smallcultfollowing-com-babysteps-blog-2019-07-08-async-await-status-report-2-future-work-the-bigger-picture">Future work: the bigger picture[](<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/07/08/async-await-status-report-2/#future-work-the-bigger-picture">http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/07/08/async-await-status-report-2/#future-work-the-bigger-picture</a>)</h2>

<p>The current stabilization push, as I mentioned above, is aimed at getting an MVP stabilized – just enough to enable people to run off and start to build things. So you’re probably wondering, what are some of the things that come next? Here is a (incomplete) list of possible future work:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A core set of async traits and combinators.</strong>  Basically a 1.0 version of the  <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/futures-rs">futures-rs repository</a>, offering key interfaces like  <code>AsyncRead</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Better stream support.</strong>  The  <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/futures-rs">futures-rs repository</a>  contains a  <code>Stream</code>  trait, but there remains some “support work” to make it better supported. This may include  <a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/for-await-i/">some form of for-await syntax</a>(although that is not a given).</li>
<li><strong>Generators and async generators.</strong>  The same core compiler transform that enables async await should enable us to support Python- or JS-like generators as a way to write iterators. Those same generators can then be made asynchronous to produce streams of data.</li>
<li><strong>Async fn in traits and trait impls.</strong>  Writing generic crates and interfaces that work with  <code>async fn</code>  is possible in the MVP, but not as clean or elegant as it could be. Supporting  <code>async fn</code>  in traits is an obvious extension to make that nicer, though we have to figure out all of the interactions with the rest of the trait system.</li>
<li><strong>Async closures.</strong>  We would like to support the obvious  <code>async ||</code>  syntax that would generate a closure. This may require tinkering with the  <code>Fn</code>  trait hierarchy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-you-can-get-involved-http-smallcultfollowing-com-babysteps-blog-2019-07-08-async-await-status-report-2-how-you-can-get-involved">How you can get involved[](<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/07/08/async-await-status-report-2/#how-you-can-get-involved">http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/07/08/async-await-status-report-2/#how-you-can-get-involved</a>)</h2>

<p>There’s been a lot of great work on the  <code>async fn</code>  implementation since my first post – we’ve closed over  <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AAsyncAwait-Blocking+is%3Aclosed">40 blocker issues</a>! I want to give a special shout out to the folks who worked on those issues:<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/07/08/async-await-status-report-2/#fn:forgot">2</a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>davidtwco</strong>  reworked the desugaring so that the drop order for parameters in an  <code>async fn</code>  and  <code>fn</code>is analagous, and then heroically fixed a number of minor bugs that were filed as fallout from this change.</li>
<li><strong>tmandry</strong>  dramatically reduced the size of futures at runtime.</li>
<li><strong>gilescope</strong>  improved a number of error messages and helped to reduce errors.</li>
<li><strong>matthewjasper</strong>  reworked some details of the compiler transform to solve a large number of ICEs.</li>
<li><strong>doctorn</strong>  fixed an ICE when  <code>await</code>  was used in inappropriate places.</li>
<li><strong>centril</strong>  has been helping to enumerate tests and generally work on triage work.</li>
<li><strong>cramertj</strong>  implemented the  <code>await</code>  syntax, wrote a bunch of tests, and, of course, did all of the initial implementation work.</li>
<li>and hey, I extended the region inferencer to support multiple lifetime parameters. I guess I get some credit too. =)</li>
</ul>
